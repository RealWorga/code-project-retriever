# Project Code Retriever

This is a simple implementation of a Python CLI program that can be used by developers to create informationally-dense (token limited) context retrieved from your project repository for inference with a code-instruct-tuned LLMs.
The goal here is to get the context copied over to your clipboard, and get information about the token count.

## Usage
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus sollicitudin sem sit amet justo tincidunt, cursus mattis lorem malesuada. Sed ut leo quis dui mattis egestas ac quis dolor. Nam condimentum lorem id turpis dapibus, at posuere dolor tempor. Nulla ac sollicitudin massa, a facilisis sem. Vestibulum nisi lectus, scelerisque.

## Good-to-know
This program assumes that you have written modular code. Adhering to simple coding principles makes your code more readable for both humans and LLMs without necessitating superflous docstrings or code comments.

## Limitations and Contributions
Currently this is just a quick implementation, I will maybe incrementally enhance its robustness and functionalities, if I have time.

It's an open project, so contributions that come as pull requests or adding issues to this repo is warmly welcomed.
